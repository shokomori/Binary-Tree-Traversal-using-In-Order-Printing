# Binary Tree Traversal - In-Order Printing

A Python program that demonstrates **in-order traversal** on a binary tree.  
This example constructs two binary trees representing the names **Masato** and **Martin**, and prints their nodes in in-order sequence.

## Author

## Features
- Custom `Node` class implementation
- In-order traversal using recursion
- Visualization of character-based binary trees

## Output
```
First Binary Tree (Masato):
A A T M O S 

Second Binary Tree (Martin):
A T M R I N 
```

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the script to a `.py` file.
3. Run it using your terminal or IDE:

```bash
